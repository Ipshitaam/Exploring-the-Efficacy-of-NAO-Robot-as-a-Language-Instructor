## Overview

This is a research project aimed at exploring the effectiveness of using the NAO robot as a Japanese language instructor compared to traditional human instructors and language-learning Android apps. By conducting a comprehensive study, we seek to understand the potential of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) in language education and assess its impact on learning outcomes.

## Project Goals

1. **Assess the Effectiveness of NAO as a Language Instructor**
2. **Compare Language Acquisition and Retention**
3. **Examine Overall Learning Experiences**
4. **Identify Learning Curve Variations**
5. **Provide Insights into HRI in Language Education**
6. **Validate the Role of Humanoid Robots in Language Education**
7. **Enhance Educational Strategies**
8. **Contribute to the Field of Human-Robot Interaction**


## Preliminary Precautions
- **Consent of Participants and their Parents:** Ensure explicit and well-informed consent is obtained not only from all participants but also from the parents of participants.
* **Presence of Caregiver or Observer:** Guarantee the presence of caregivers or observers to ensure the safety of participants.
+ **Controlled Environment:** Create and sustain an environment that is controlled, minimizing distractions for emotionally supportive sessions.


## Work Done Thus Far
- Pre-test and post-test questions were finalized based on the initial selection of Japanese words.
- The coding based on the design of the full learning session has been done.
- The questionnaire has been finalized for taking the feedback from the participants.
- Data collected from participants from pre-tests, post-tests and questionnaires
- Data analysis
- Results and conclusions
